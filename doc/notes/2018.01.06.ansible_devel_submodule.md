Ansible `devel` Branch as a Submodule
==============================================================================

I've forked the [devel][ansible/ansible@devel] branch of [ansible/ansible][] (where activer development happens) at ansible/ansible@b7bf98cd to [nrser/ansible][] (maintaining `devel` as the active and default branch) and added as a submodule at `//packages/python/ansible`.

Because:

1.  I specifically needed `include_role` to properly template it's `name` parameter, which is fixed in `devel` and presumably slated to land in `2.5` but broken in `2.4`. Which leads me too...
    
2.  Stuff is broken in Ansible *all the time*. Like no other production software I've ever used. There are nearly [4,000 open issues on GitHub][Ansible issues]. Which has painfully and eventually led me to
    1.  Since the release versions are so riddled with bugs (sorry guys, it just really is), might as well use the active development version and at least be able to take advantages of fixes as soon as possible.
        
        This is my first excursion into using `devel`, so I'm yet to see if this results in a better or worse experience, but at this point I'm willing to try.
        
    2.  I'm going to need to fix and improve things myself.

This is super experimental, and going to be behind configuration options for the time being, but I think it's quite possibly the only real path forward to build reliable and sane software that takes advantage of Ansible's expansive module library.
