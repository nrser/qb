# positional argument. if a positional argument is provided it will
# override the method defined here.

# options:
# 
# -   null
#     -   require the value on the command line.
# -   false
#     -   don't provide qb_dir (means doesn't load or save options either).
# -   git_root
#     -   use the git root of the directory that the `qb` command is invoked
#         from. useful for 'project-centric' commands so they can be invoked
#         from anywhere in the repo.
# -   cwd
#     -   use the directory the `qb` command is invoked form.
# -   {exe: PATH}
#     -   invoke an executable, passing a JSON serialization of the options 
#         mapping their CLI names to values. path can be relative to role
#         directory.
# -   {find_up: FILENAME}
#     -   starting at the current directory and climbing up to parent 
#         directories, use the first one that contains FILENAME. error
#         if none is found.
default_dir: false

# If `true`, QB will ensure the default dir exists before starting the play.
# 
# For legacy reasons, this defaults to `true` if not present, but we want to 
# default declare it as `false` here so new roles can turn it on only if 
# they need it.
