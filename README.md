QB
==============================================================================

QB is all about projects. Named after everyone's favorite projects.

QB works by running [Ansible][] plays. So you can think about it as "quarterback" if you happen to be from the corner of the world where that makes any sense.

You generally want to read these docs at

<http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/qb/>

where the links are more likely to work.

Or, if you're working from a local clone, by booting the [yard][] server via

    bundle exec yard server

and opening

<http://localhost:8808>

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  Status: **UNSTABLE**
    
    A bit past experimental, but still actively exploring API and features. Any and every thing subject to breaking changes until we hit `1.0`. Generally trying to bump the minor version with larger changes, but not paying a huge amount of attention to it. Being used personally and in projects and organizations I work with.

2.  Compatibility: **OSX/macOS-only**
    
    Though it would probably run fine on Linux, if not other \*nix as well.

3.  Installation
    
    Head over to {file:doc/getting_started.md Getting Started}.

4.  More Info
    
    There is some semblance of an {file:doc/intro.md Introduction} available to get indignant about.
