scratch work.

for playing around with ideas, testing things out, etc. i find it useful to keep this stuff around so i can refer back to it, though this directory should be cleaned up from time to time to remove long outdated code.

generally, work should be put in it's own directory (unless it's just a single file) so it's clear what belongs to what.
