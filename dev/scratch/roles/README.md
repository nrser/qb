`//dev/scratch/roles` - Scratch-work Roles to Play Around With
==============================================================================

Where I dump roles when developing / playing around / hand-testing stuff.

The path is added in local dev when running `qb` in the project root via `roles_path` in `//ansible.cfg`.

These things should probably be made into tests, or even start out like that, but this is honestly quicker and easier most the time.

I try to clean it up every once in a while. Like today. But not much.
